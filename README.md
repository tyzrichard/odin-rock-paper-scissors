# Rock, Paper, Scissors!
A simple game I made using Javascript, as part of the Odin Foundations course.
It currently plays 5 rounds of this classic game against an computer-controlled opponent, and outputs the results of the game after!

## Update: RPS Enhanced!!
The current version has been **completely revamped** to give a MUCH BETTER playing experience!
Gone are the crappy console print texts and alert dialogs, and in it's place is a very good looking UI!

Have a rundown of all the new features:
1. Text on-screen that lets users know the current round, and instructions on what to do
2. Cards (divs actually) that act as clickable choices for their rock-paper-scissors input
3. Material 3 design! Looks good actually, took me some time to get it all designed out on Figma
4. And most importantly, the game itself has been expanded. Now we get to play the 5-item version of RPS!

## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock!!!
Now how does this thing work?

You could just read an article on it online (its well known enough), but here are the rules:
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

Every item has two others it can beat, and two others it can get beaten by. So much less tying with your opponent!

## Future Updates??
Well, you may have noticed the icons at the bottom. For now, they don't do anything, but in the future, I'll update them to toggle dark mode, extra settings and show the rules/info of the game.

*well, erm, no. I'm too lazy to ever update this thing, so that's that.*

Anyways, have fun with this website! It's the most advanced one I've made so far (not a very high bar tbh), and I had a fun time doing so.
